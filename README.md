## Visualizing the Elite

https://cinhui.github.io/visualizingtheelite/

The motivation behind this project is to utilize wrestling match data to provide an overview of how your favorite wrestlers are performing in terms of wins and losses, how often wrestlers are used on specific programs, and how wrestlers are being featured in in-ring competitions. The interactive dashboards can be used to enable users to explore the rankings and statistics among wrestlers. The analytical platform can be used to assist in developing storylines among wrestlers.

Data was retrieved from Cagematch The Internet Wrestling Database. The scraping was performed using Python and Beautiful Soup. The data was then written to JSON files and imported into Tableau for analysis.
